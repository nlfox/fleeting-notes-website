Link-based note-taking apps are centred around the use of [wikilinks](wikilinks.md). Wikilinks are typically created by surrounding the text with double square brackets.

Some examples include but aren't limited to:

* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
* [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)
* [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)
